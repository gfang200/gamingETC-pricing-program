Case Study: MTG Pricing Program
============
The MTG Pricing Program is an end to end business solution I built for small business owner, Michelle Cove, over a 2 month engagement with her business, Gaming ETC, in 2016. The goal of the end product was to help her optimize the daily re-pricing of her inventory of over 10,000 unique cards, collectively worth over $100,000.

Problem Statement
--------------- 
Magic the Gathering© is a trading card game that has been operated by Wizards of the Coast© since 1993. Since it's inception, over 12,000 unique cards have been printed, played and sold. Similar to a stock market, the value of these cards fluctuates daily based on the 'Meta' (popular cards) and 'rarity' (how many cards exist). Unlike the stock market, which has transitioned to a digital first market in the 21st century, Magic the Gathering© cards still exist primarily as a physical asset.<br/><br/>

This presents a unique challenge to local game stores, brick and mortar locations who make their primary margins by optimizing the transaction between players looking to sell their old cards, and players looking to buy new cards. Since Magic© cards are bought and sold as physical goods in a fluctuating price market, having up to date pricing on the trading cards is crucial to operating a successful business.<br/><br/>

Gaming ETC is one of the top 10 biggest local game store's in the world, with an inventory of over 10,000 unique cards, collectively worth over $100,000 in market value. A significant portion of this market value is contained within the top 200 cards, sometimes valued at up to $10,000 for a single card. These cards, making the highest margins for the owner, are displayed in cases, with clearly marked price tags. Once a customer declares intent to purchase one of these cards at the marked price, it is difficult to change the price without creating a poor customer experience. <br/><br/>

Since the prices for these large ticket cards are often times the most volatile to price movements, this presents a real business need to have to most up to date market price for these cards.

Sample Projects
--------------- 
#### Scraping and Scripting #### 
A select sample of scripts that I've written to scrape the web. It includes examples of:  
* Working with iFrames in Selenium
* Overcoming shadow root nodes in the DOM by dynamically generating xdotool shell scripts.
* Recursive search in web scraping
* Basic URLLib usage to scrape metadata & download images 

#### DatastudioTools #### 
This one's got a pretty cool story! While doing consulting work for Accenture, one of my clients had her heart set on downloading graphs from one of Google's analytics tool, Datastudio. Unfortunately, the product did not support this feature. <br/><br/>The rational course of action here would be to give up, but instead of that I build a tool that pulls in SVG images, extracts the vector & text data, and finally redraws the image on a PNG, thus rendering the image in a downloadable state. Bonus points since it supported transparency layers too!

#### GameLTVModel #### 
This is an early version of a model I developed alongside a data scientist. It is designed to calculate the player lifetime value for a mobile game based on the initial actions of the user. As the data engineer on this engagement, my main role on the team was to translate the model into Python code, transform training data into a consumable state, build back-testing modules, and deploy the code into a live production environment.  <br/><br/>*Note that this is an alpha version of the model, for confidentiality reasons, I can't share the full model!

#### selectWorksFromFreemo #### 
A few select code samples from a WebApp project I've been working on recently in NodeJS. In summary, it's an app that runs selenium scripts on a scalable kubernetes cloud container engine to interact with web models at scale. The project's very very early in pre-alpha-closed-beta, but you can still check out the site @ www.tryfreemo.com :)

#### excelHomeworkHacking #### 
This one is pretty troll. I was a TA for a business excel class once where the professors were **SUPER** proud of these xslm macros they created to detect cheating in their classrooms. They would spend a few hours every semester talking about how the system couldn't be beaten. After watching some bankers use excel without a mouse, I used a windows scripting language that supported hardware emulation to create a system that emulated keyboard inputs to complete homework assingments.  I never distributed this to students, since I don't condone cheating, but it was pretty trollerino to show the professors that I could beat their system.

#### BONUSreallyCoolExcelModel #### 
This one's not even code. I found this in one of my old desktop backups while looking for cool stuff to include in my GitHub.    <br/><br/>Before I learned how to code, I learned how to excel. I also didn't let my lack of knowledge of fully functional programming languages stop me from doing cool stuff. One of the things I noticed through observation is that some professors are more lenient graders than other professors. Then, I built this slick, 9 page excel model that took anonymized student GPA data and determined the best professor for each class based on difficulty xD.
